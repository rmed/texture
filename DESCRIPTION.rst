texture
=======

    (...) I rejected those answers. Instead, I chose something
    different. I chose the (im)possible. I chose... texture

texture is a micro-engine for creating text-based adventures.

Features
--------

-  Scenario based architecture
-  Global game state
-  Some utilities
-  Main game loop (including command input)

That's it. This is only a (pretty simple) tool, and you are the artist.
Want your game to calculate x digits of *pi*? Well, go for it!

Documentation coming soon
